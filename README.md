# React Portfolio
This is my portfolio implemented using react

Previously I made my portfolio using a rendering engine known as handlebars to
render everything nicely. This version of it is different, and it uses 
[react](https://reactjs.org/) as a means of rendering. 

This is just a front end so it is deployed to github pages here:
